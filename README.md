<h1>Delivery System Payments</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

This repository is part of a microservices-based architecture project.

It is an API responsible for handling payment-related endpoints, designed to manage operations within the payment domain. The main goal of this project is to study and explore the implementation and structure of microservices in a distributed system.

This service is configured as a Eureka client, enabling service discovery and communication with other components in the architecture. It uses a PostgreSQL database to persist payment data.

The API was developed with a focus on modularity and separation of concerns, aiming to simulate real-world use cases in a service-oriented architecture.

<h2>Related Projects</h2>

This project is part of a distributed system composed of multiple microservices. Below is a list of the main repositories and their roles:

- **[Delivery System Gateway](https://github.com/your-org/delivery-system-gateway)**:  
  Acts as the API gateway for the entire system. Built with Spring Cloud Gateway, it routes external requests to the appropriate microservices and handles load balancing.


- **[Delivery System Server](https://github.com/your-org/delivery-system-server)**:  
  A Eureka server responsible for service discovery. It enables microservices to register themselves and discover other services dynamically.


- **[Delivery System Orders](https://github.com/your-org/delivery-system-orders)**:  
  A microservice dedicated to managing order-related operations. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, retrieving, and canceling orders, and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

The project is organized in a way that ensures clarity and scalability. Below is a summary of the main folders and files:

- **`Controllers/`**: Responsible for managing HTTP requests and delegating actions to the corresponding services.

- **`Services/`**: Contains the business logic, implementing CRUD methods and other operations related to tasks and users.

- **`DTOs/`**: Defines data transfer objects used for communication between application layers.

- **`Exceptions/`**: Defines custom exceptions and error handling for a clear and controlled response in case of failures.

- **`Models/`**: Represents database entities, such as the Task and User models.

- **`Repository/`**: Contains database access logic and interfaces responsible for data persistence, handling interaction with the database.

- **`Config/`**: Contains configuration files for bean definitions and other application-level settings to improve modularity and manage dependencies.
